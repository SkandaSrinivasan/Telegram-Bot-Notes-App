# Telegram-Bot-Notes-App
Displays a list of notes from my mongo database in a react app.

My telegram bot parses any urls sent to it and stores in the DB. 

This app is for serving up the notes saved in above way, and also lets me delete stuff.

Telegram Bot code is at : https://github.com/SkandaSrinivasan/TelegramEchoBot

App and bot hosted on heroku.
